North Sea Chess
---------------
North sea chess comes from the manwua "A returner's magic should be special". I wanted to implement it as
a multiplayer application. If two users both have this application, they can coordinate to play together online.

Not to be used for profit. Fan project only.

No queens


Added Features
--------------
Four bishops and knights each to work with
The board is now increased from 8x8 to 18x8, (x,y)
